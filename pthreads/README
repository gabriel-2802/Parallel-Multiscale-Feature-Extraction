This project implements a parallel image processing
pipeline using pthreads.
The pipeline consisits of the following steps, executed for each layer:
- Parallel convolution using pthreads
- Local min/max computation per thread
- Global min/max reduction
- Parallel normalization using pthreads
Each layer processes the output of the previous one.

### Convolution
- The image is split by rows.
- Each pthread processes a contiguous block of rows.
- Threads compute:
  - convolution output
  - local minimum
  - local maximum

### Min / Max Reduction
- After all threads finish, the local min/max values are combined to obtain:
  - global minimum
  - global maximum  
- This step is done serially (low overhead, small number of threads).

### Normalization
- A second set of pthreads normalizes the output image using the global min/max values.
- Each thread processes a different range of rows.
