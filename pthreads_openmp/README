This project implements a hybrid parallel image processing pipeline using pthreads and OpenMP.
For each layer, the following steps are executed:
- Parallel convolution using pthreads
- Parallelism using OpenMP inside each thread
- Global min/max reduction using OpenMP
- Parallel normalization using pthreads and OpenMP
Each layer processes the output of the previous one.

### Convolution
- The image is split by rows across pthreads.
- Each pthread processes a contiguous block of rows.
- Inside each pthread, OpenMP is used to parallelize the inner pixel loops.
- Each thread computes:
  - convolution output
  - local minimum
  - local maximum

### Min / Max Reduction
- Local min/max values are combined using an OpenMP reduction.
- This step has low overhead due to the small number of values.

### Normalization
- A second set of pthreads performs image normalization.
- OpenMP is used to parallelize pixel processing inside each thread.
